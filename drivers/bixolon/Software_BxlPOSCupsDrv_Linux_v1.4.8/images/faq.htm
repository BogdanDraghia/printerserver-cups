<a name="No12"><b>6.BIXOLON CUPS Driver printer setting through Open Office is not taking effect. What could be the reason?</a><br>
</b> </a><br>
<p>
   This problem is not related with our driver, is related with the linkage between the Open Office and CUPS. Since our driver is based on CUPS, whatever the setting you made through Open Office will override by CUPS admin. So please use CUPS Admin tool to change the printer settings.
